                    <p>Among the things a true coffee lover needs to know is the effect caffeine has on our body. There are people who love coffee because of its taste or the ritual of drinking it but business people usually drink coffee because they are after that sweet caffeine rush.

                        In this sense, we’ll be straightforward and say that caffeine is actually a psychoactive drug and a popular one, for that matter. The effect it has on our brain is related to the way we produce and use adenosine, a nucleoside composed of D-ribose and adenine.
                        
                        Neurons in our brain produce adenosine as they fire during the day. Once they have produced enough adenosine, the nervous system reacts by putting the entire body to sleep. That is why you might feel exhausted in the afternoon even if you haven’t done anything particular that day.
